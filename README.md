OllaLama
OllaLama is a AI powered Roblox Studio Game Coder/Builder that integrates with Ollama.

OllaLama is an experimental plugin for Roblox Studio that integrates directly with the Ollama ecosystem. It enables developers to use Ollama-powered AI models to assist with scripting, building, and automating workflows inside Studio. The plugin is currently in a rough beta phase, and continued development is planned as the project evolves.

A key feature of OllaLama is its built-in SAI Mode. When enabled, SAI Mode leverages an enhanced layer of intelligence designed specifically for Roblox Studio tasks, allowing any supported model to perform more context-aware coding and building operations. While not yet perfect, SAI Mode already delivers strong, practical results for creators looking to accelerate their development process.
